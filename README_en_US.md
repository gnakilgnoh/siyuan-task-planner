# Task Planner

This is a plug-in designed for Siyuan Notes: Task Planner.

## Original intention

When multiple projects are carried out at the same time in the work, it is often unclear about the priority of the task and the deadline of the task. Tick list, which has been used for some time before, still agrees with the task planning function of its calendar view, but it is naturally not suitable as a note system, so I came up with the idea of implementing a similar task management view plug-in in Siyuan notes.

## Summarize the requirements
> the following are my personal requirements, which will be adjusted according to the actual usage.

- Task list management function
  - Support task creation, deletion and priority management.
- Calendar  
  - Moon view
  - Weekly view
  - Three-day view

## Function

After my personal preliminary requirements are realized, I will describe the functions here.

## Operation mode

After the installation is completed, the icon corresponding to the plug-in will appear on the right side of the top bar. After clicking it, a tab will be created, and the plug-in can be used in the tab.
